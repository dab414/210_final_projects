# 210 Final Projects

This repository contains the material, data, and analyses for the final projects in a research methods course at Lehigh University.

**Students:** Go to the folder that corresponds to your respective group to find all resources associated with your project.

The general layout of the repository (for both groups) is as follows:  

* `./data` — contains raw data and cleaned (preprocessed data), as well as some other complementary data (e.g., survey responses)
* `./materials` — contains everything used for running the experiment (EPrime scripts and data for music group, Qualtrics forms for integrity group)
* `./notebook` — contains the files that summarize the analyses (the most important resource for writing your "Results" section)
